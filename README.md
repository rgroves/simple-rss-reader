# Developer Notes

These notes are both for me keeping track of what I've done and my thought process along the way of trying to build out a simple RSS reader using Python, Django, and Django REST Framework.

## Getting Setup

```
# Create and activate a virutal environment
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# Install djanog and djangorestframework
python -m pip install django
python -m pip install djangorestframework
```
